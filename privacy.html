      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        FederalPathAI is a personal project created to help individuals draft federal-style
        resumes using AI. This Privacy Policy explains, in simple terms, what information
        may be collected, how it may be used, and your choices.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information You Provide</h2>
      <p>
        When you use FederalPathAI, you may choose to input text such as job announcements,
        work history, or accomplishments. That content is used to generate resume drafts.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should avoid entering sensitive personal information (such as Social Security
        numbers, full birthdates, medical details, or other highly confidential data).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How the Tool Works</h2>
      <p>
        FederalPathAI uses a third-party AI model to process the text you submit and to
        generate draft resumes. The AI processing is provided by an external service
        (for example, Google AI or similar) and may be subject to that provider’s own
        privacy and data handling practices.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Analytics and Logs</h2>
      <p>
        Basic technical information (such as page views, approximate region, or browser
        type) may be collected through standard web analytics tools. This is used to
        understand site usage and improve the experience.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Use of Information</h2>
      <p>
        Any information entered into the tool is used solely to generate drafts and to
        improve the quality and reliability of the service. The creator does not sell
        individual user data.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
      <p>
        FederalPathAI may link to third-party sites or use third-party services for hosting,
        analytics, or AI processing. Those services have their own terms and privacy
        policies. You should review those policies separately.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may choose what information to input when using the tool.</li>
        <li>You can close the site at any time and discontinue use.</li>
        <li>If you have concerns about content you entered, avoid including sensitive or personal data in future use.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Continued use of the site after
        changes are posted indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can reach out through the
        contact information provided on the Contact page.
